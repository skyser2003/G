[ SOURCE OR BINARY? ]

    If you just want to *use* the plugin in your game (as opposed to modify it),
    this directory is the wrong place to look. There is a pre-built and ready-to-use
    version of the plugin in the "current-build" directory. Refer to the root
    README.md file for more information.


[ REPOSITORY CONTENTS ]

    SupportLib/
        Source code for the Java support lib (the JAR file)

    PluginDev/
        Unity project for developing and debugging the plugin

    docgen/
        Source code documentation generation config.


[ HOW TO BUILD THE PLUGIN ]

1. If you've modified something in the support library (SupportLib), rebuild the support
   library to generate the JAR (run ./update_support_lib.sh).

2. Open the PluginDev project in Unity

3. Export a Unity package through the "Google Play Games | Export Plugin Package"
   option.

Note: If you need to manually generate the plugin for whatever reason, the
directories to export and files to exclude can be seen in the source code
for the exporter (Assets/Editor/GPGSExportPackageUI.cs).

To test the plugin before exporting it, you can use the PluginDev project itself.
Simply configure it (by clicking File | Play Games Android Setup), and set up
your test achievement/leaderboard IDs in Assets/Settings.cs.
